Python Tutorial for ECEN2703

-Click the launch button below to access a temporary coding environment in which you can create and edit jupyter notebooks to test your python code. The environment has Z3 already installed so you don't have to worry about it.
-Remember: To run the code in the jupyter notebook cells you can press SHIFT + ENTER.
-Don't forget to download the jupyter notebook or copy the contents of it before closing the browser tab in which it is running. All the files edited and "saved" in the environment are temporary.

**Disclaimer**: Sometimes it takes time to prepare the environment so please be patient. Also, if you have already installed Z3 locally, please use that instance. The server can get slow if there are too many people connected.
